## Install

This project requires [**Node.js**](https://nodejs.org) **^8.11.0 || >=10.13.0**. Install it using
[**yarn**](https://yarnpkg.com) or [**npm**](https://npmjs.com).  
_We highly recommend to use Yarn when you think to contribute to this project._

```bash
$ yarn add git-commits-since
```

## Usage

In this example, we show how this package can be used in combination with [parse-commit-message][]
and [detect-next-version][] to make robust automation, pblish & release flow.

_This actually is used in the [@tunnckocore/release-cli](https://github.com/tunnckoCore/release-cli) 
and the [Release GitHub App](https://github.com/tunnckoCore/release).  
In the CLI commits are collected from `git log` using this module, 
in the App commits are from the GitHub API._

**Example**

```js
import { applyPlugins, plugins, parse, check } from 'parse-commit-message';
import gitCommitsSince from 'git-commits-since';
import detector from 'detect-next-version';

async function main() {
  const { rawCommits } = await gitCommitsSince({ cwd: 'path/to/repo' });
  const commits = applyPlugins(plugins, check(parse(rawCommits)));

  // detect-next-version, also can accept rawCommits (array of strings) directly,
  // but that is that way just for demo purposes.
  const result = await detector('my-npm-package', commits);

  console.log(result);
  console.log(result.pkg);
  console.log(result.patch);
  console.log(result.increment); // => 'patch'
  console.log(result.isBreaking); // => false
  console.log(result.lastVersion); // => 0.1.0
  console.log(result.nextVersion); // => 0.1.1
}
```

## API

<!-- docks-start -->
_Generated using [docks](http://npm.im/docks)._

### [src/index.js](/src/index.js)

#### [gitCommitsSince](/src/index.js#L53)
Gets all commits since given `options.from` or since last semver tag (by default).
In return you will get useful metadata and `rawCommits`.
Where `rawCommits` is an array of commit message strings. Optionally you can pass
a `options.plugin` functin which is passed with `(rawCommit: string, result: object)`
signature and will be called on each commit. This behavior can be used
to do fun stuff on per each project basis. Such as parsing each rawCommit or whatever.

**Params**
- `options` **{object}** basically passed to [git-raw-commits][] and [git-semver-tags][]

**Returns**
- `Promise<object>` resolves to an object with `{ from, to, cwd, rawCommits }`

**Examples**
```javascript
import gitCommitsSince from 'git-commits-since';

async function main() {
  const result = await gitCommits({ cwd: 'path/to/git/repository' });

  console.log(result);
  // the @ means HEAD or the latest commit
  // => { from: 'v0.1.0', to: '@', cwd: 'path/to/cwd', rawCommits, options }
}

main().catch(console.error);
```
```javascript
import gitCommitsSince from 'git-commits-since';

// Using the plugin API
async function main() {
  const plugin = (rawCommitString, result) => {
    console.log(rawCommitString);
    // log each commit

    result.qux = 12345;

    return { foo: 'bar' };
  };

  const res = await gitCommitsSince({ plugin });
  console.log(res);
  console.log(res.rawCommits);
  console.log(res.foo); // => 'bar'
  console.log(res.qux); // => 12345
}

main().catch(console.error);
```
