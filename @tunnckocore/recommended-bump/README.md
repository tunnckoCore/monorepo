## API

<!-- docks-start -->
_Generated using [docks](http://npm.im/docks)._

### [src/index.js](/src/index.js)

#### [recommendedBump](/src/index.js#L48)
Calculates recommended bump (next version), based on given `commitMessages`.
It always returns an object. If no commits are given it is `{ increment: false }`.
Otherwise it may contain `patch`, `minor`, or `major` properties which are
of `Array<CommitObject>` type, based on [parse-commit-message][].

See the tests and examples for more clarity.
It understands and follows [Conventional Commits Specification](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/).

**Params**
- `commitMessages` **{Array&lt;string&gt;}** an array of commit message strings

**Returns**
- `object` result like `{ increment: boolean, ?patch[]

**Examples**
```javascript
import recommendedBump from 'recommended-bump';

async function main() {
  const commits = [
    'chore: foo bar baz',
    `fix(cli): some bugfix msg here

Some awesome body.

Great footer and GPG sign off, yeah!
Signed-off-by: Awesome footer <foobar@gmail.com>
`
  ];

  const { increment, minor } = recommendedBump(commits);

  console.log(increment); // => 'minor'
  console.log(minor);
  // => [{ header: { type, scope, subject, toString() }, body, footer }]
  console.log(minor[0].header.type); // => 'fix'
  console.log(minor[0].header.scope); // => 'cli'
  console.log(minor[0].header.subject); // => 'some bugfix msg here'
  console.log(minor[0].header.toString()); // => 'fix(cli): some bugfix msg here'
  console.log(minor[0].body); // => 'Some awesome body.'
  console.log(minor[0].footer);
  // => 'Great footer and GPG sign off, yeah!\nSigned-off-by: Awesome footer <foobar@gmail.com>'
}

main().catch(console.error);
```
